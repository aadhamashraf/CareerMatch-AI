CareerMatch is a unified AI-driven career assistant built from a modular set of features: it starts by parsing a candidate’s CV into structured sections (CV Parsing & Section Detection) and scores resumes with an explainable scoring engine while running bias & fairness audits to ensure equitable results. Using those signals, an adaptive recommendation system personalizes next steps — recommending targeted micro-projects, hands-on auto-generated project skeletons, and skill-gap courses — all tracked through a gamified skill-tree and engagement-prediction scoring to keep users motivated. A dynamic knowledge graph ties user skills, roles and resources together to power context-aware recommendations and transparent career roadmaps, while on-demand resume polishing and dataset generation let users iterate quickly and test models — everything backed by clear explainability and fairness checks so users and recruiters trust the results.
